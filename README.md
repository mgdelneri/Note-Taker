# Note-Taker

## GOAL

The goal of this project was to modify starter code to create a Note Taker application that is used to write and save notes. This application is meant to use an Express.js back-end and to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. 

The starter code consists of all of the front-end. Our job was to build all of the back-end, connect the two, and then deploy the application in Heroku. 

## PROCESS

At first, I made sure I had all of the starter code well organized in my repo. I then looked closely at the intructions for the assignment, reviewed activities from relevant units, and created the back-end files that I thought would be necessary for this application. 

At this point, I started looking at the starter code and trying to make sense of it. This helped in brainstorming and mapping out my next steps.
