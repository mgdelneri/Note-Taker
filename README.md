# Note-Taker

## GOAL

The goal of this project was to modify starter code to create a Note Taker application that is used to write and save notes. This application is meant to use an Express.js back-end and to save and retrieve note data from a JSON file. 

The starter code consists of all of the front-end. Our job was to build all of the back-end, connect the two, and then deploy the application in Heroku. 

## PROCESS

At first, I made sure I had all of the starter code well organized in my repo. I then looked closely at the intructions for the assignment, reviewed activities from relevant units, and created the back-end files that I thought would be necessary for this application. 

At this point, I started looking at the starter code and trying to make sense of it. This helped in brainstorming and mapping out my next steps. 

The next step was a long stretch of pseudo-coding and writing out lists of possible strategies to attack the back-end of this project. 

Using past activities as a template, I started coding the HTML Routes file. I then started coding the API Routes file as well. I quickly realized that I could not test any of this code without creating a server, so I coded the server.js file. The htmlRoutes.js and server.js files proved to be simple and easier to understand. The apiRoutes.js took a lot of trial and error to figure out, especially when it came to coding the POST request. Once that was figured out, however, I was able to add a DELETE request to my code. 

The final steps of this project involved testing the application several times for any bugs and then deploying it to Heroku. 

Here is a walkthrough video of Note-Taker's functionality:

## CONCLUSION

I would have never been able to get as far as I did in this assignment if I had not collaborated with my classmates on it, as well as get help from my tutor. Tutors are of course helpful because of their expertise and their ability to help you get back on track and point you in the right direction. That being said, the study groups with my peers are proving to be invaluable on so many levels. Not only do we help each other out with the actual content of the assignment, but it also shows me that I am not alone in my difficulties and that I am even able to help others at times. It helps boost our confidence and encourages us to keep pushing through the many hurdles of coding. I imagine this is great practice for the work force as well. 

As for the material covered in this unit and in this assignment, I found it to be very challenging. I understand the concepts, for the most part, but successfully tying them together through back-end logic and syntax took a very long time. The first part of the challenge was thoroughly understanding the logic and functionality of the front-end starter code given to us. This was also very good practice for what I imagine is a very common activity when working with coding outside of the classroom. When tackling the back-end code, the most challenging part for me was making sure that all of the syntax was correct, so the logic would work appropriately. I did notice that, once certain parts were coded and working, the next few sections became easier. 

I have noticed a promising pattern with each new project assigned: they do get harder and increasingly more complex, but each one makes the material from the weeks before seem less and less difficult. I hope this pattern continues as I evolve as a coder and enter the work force.
